# unreddit

Using reddit's API to erase or edit _your own_ comment and submission history

:warning: work in progess, not ready

## Why?

Put your user name into [snoopsnoo](https://snoopsnoo.com/) and see just how
much information a person can find out about you, it's pretty crazy. We
unknowingly give so much away about ourselves and that can be ok for some people
but not ok for me.

I care about privacy but I also want to keep the same account. I personally
don't want too much "history" for my account so I'd rather just delete
everything older than a year or so old (you can set the threshold). This
prevents someone doxing you just in case you have given away some identifying
information in a comment and forgot about it. If you had 8 years of comments to
sift through it can be a daunting task so I wanted to automate it
